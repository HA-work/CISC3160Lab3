# CISC3160Lab3
A repository with files for a Lex and Yacc program that acts as a simple grade calculator.
There is also a reflection in the form of a word document.


The gradeCalc folder contains 4 files.
It contains a Lex file that defines some tokens.
A Yacc file that describes the type of requests that the program can fulfill.
A text file called setup that gives the 4 terminal commands needed to run the program.
A text file called sampleOutput that is the copy pasted input that I entered and the output I received when 
running the code on a Linux server.
With the same input the same results are expected and similiar input will also work.
Incorrect input can also be passed to see how the program responds.
